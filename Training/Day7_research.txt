XML:
	XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.
	XML is a markup language much like HTML
	XML was designed to store and transport data
	XML was designed to be self-descriptive
	XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
	HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
	XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are
	Syntax:
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  --->Xml Prolog
	<root>
 	 <child>
  	  <subchild>.....</subchild>
  	 </child>
	</root>
	All xml elements must have a closing tag
	xml tags are case sensitive.
	Sending an XMLHttpRequest;
	var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
	Xml also work with Ajax.
	XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language) is a styling language for XML.

	XSL(T) Languages:
	XSLT is a language for transforming XML documents.
	XPath is a language for navigating in XML documents.
	XQuery is a language for querying XML documents.

JSON:
	JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
	JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
	JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
	JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

	JSON Syntax Rules:
	Data is in name/value pairs
	Data is separated by commas
	Curly braces hold objects
	Square brackets hold arrays
	A common use of JSON is to read data from a web server, and display the data in a web page.
	JavaScript built-in function JSON.parse() to convert the string into a JavaScript object.
	var obj = JSON.parse(text);

Web Services:
	The method of communication between two devices over the network.
	It is a software system for the interoperable machine to machine communication.
	It is a collection of standards or protocols for exchanging information between two devices or application.
	There are mainly two types of web services.
	1.SOAP web services.
	2.RESTful web services.
	Web Service Features:
	XML-Based,Loosely Coupled,Supports Remote Procedure Calls.
	Web Service Components
	SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol),WSDL(Web Services Description Language),UDDI(Universal Description, Discovery and Integration).
	RESTful Web Services are fast because there is no strict specification like SOAP. It consumes less bandwidth and resource.
	RESTful web service permits different data format such as Plain Text, HTML, XML and JSON.
	SOAP Structure:
	<soap:envolop><soap:body>----------</soap:body><soap:envolop>

State management:

If a user enters information into a web application, that information would be lost in the round trip from the browser (MSDN). 
State management is a preserve state control and object in an application because ASP.NET web applications are stateless.
TYPES OF MANAGEMENT

  1). Client-Side State Management

 Whenever we use Client-Side State Management, the state related information will directly get stored on the client-side.
 That specific information will travel back and communicate with every request generated by the user then afterwards provides responses after server-side communication.
 
 => Client-side | Techniques

      -  View State
      - Hidden field
      - Cookies
      - Query Strings

 2). Server-Side State Management

 It is different from Client-Side State Management but the operations and working is somewhat the same in functionality.
 In Server-Side State Management all the information is stored in the user memory.
 Due to this functionality there is more secure domains at the server side in comparison to Client-Side State Management.

     - Session State
     - Application State
